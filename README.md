# The_numerous_approaches_to_tracking_extratropical_cyclones

Enclosed is the Python script that plots Figure 3 in "The numerous approaches to tracking ETCs and the challenges they present".

It plots both storms Ophelia (2017) and Oscar(2018) at 6 hourly timesteps using data from 3 different methods:

1. National Hurricane Center (NHC) (Data source: Stewart, S. R. 2018. Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Ophelia, 9â€“15 October 2017, National Hurricane Center.) 
2. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Modeling (NASA), Analysis and Prediction Climatology of Midlatitude Storminess (MCMS) (Data source: https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/Obs-ETC/Fronts-ETC/) 
3. N. Massey (2012;2016) (ERA5 MSLP Data: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview)
